# My favourite resources

In learning how to make the best sourdough bread, I used the following resources, going from veginner to more and more advanced.

## Beginner resources

- The Bread Code's [flowcharts](https://www.the-sourdough-framework.com/listoflocname.html) help demistify the process

## More advanced resources
- The Bread Codeâ€™s [Sourdough Framework](https://www.the-sourdough-framework.com/) book
- Flour Water Salt Yeast book by Ken Forkish
- The Sourdough Journey website

His PDF file that explains the different crumb structures is really helpful: https://thesourdoughjourney.com/faq-over-under-proofed/
