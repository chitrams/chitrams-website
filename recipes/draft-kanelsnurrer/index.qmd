Ingredients

-   320 ml full-cream milk

-   150 g butter

-   1 tablespoon finely ground cardamom seeds

-   50 g fresh yeast

-   1 egg

-   125 g sugar

-   1 teaspooon salt

-   750 g strong wheat flour

-   All-purpose flour for dusting

-   Egg wash

Filling

-   200 g butter, softened
-   2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
-   100 g sugar

Decoration

-   Pearl sugar, optional
-   White icing, optional

Method

1.  Combine milk, butter, and cardamom in a small pan. Heat until the butter melts. Leave to cool until cool to touch, slightly warmer than room temperature, and dissolve the yeast in this liquid.
2.  Transfer the liquid and yeast mix to a large bowl. Add the egg, sugar, salt, and flour; knead until smooth, shiny, and elastic. The dough should come off the sides of the bowl easily.
3.  Cover the bowl with a clean dish towel, and leave to rise until doubled in size.
