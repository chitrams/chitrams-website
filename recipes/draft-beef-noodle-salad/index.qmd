Serves 4. Adapted from David Tanis' Vietnamese Lemongrass Beef and Noodle Salad on NYT Cooking.

## All ingredients, for reference

It is a lot of ingredients, but most of are things you'd have in the pantry anyway if you do a lot of Asian-style cooking. The preparation is also simple, so don't let the ingredient list intimidate you. It takes me about 45 minutes to make.

**Dipping sauce**

-   5 tablespoons light brown sugar (4+1)
-   3 tablespoons rice vinegar
-   4 tablespoons lime juice (from two large limes, or use bottled)
-   6 tablespoons fish sauce[^1] (4+2)
-   5 garlic cloves - minced (2+3)
-   3 cm piece of ginger - peeled and minced
-   2 chillies - chopped

[^1]: Use good quality fish sauce. In Australia, I prefer Squid or Red Boat. See [this blog post](https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/fish-sauce-101/) for what makes a good good fish sauce.

**Salad**

-   340 g rice vermicelli noodles
-   1 head lettuce
-   1 medium carrot
-   1 small cucumber
-   1 daikon radish
-   A handful of bean sprouts

**Beef stir-fry**

-   500 g beef - sliced thinly (less than 1 cm thick)
-   80g lemongrass paste or 3 tablespoons lemongrass - tender centres finely chopped[^2]
-   Vegetable oil - for stir-frying

[^2]: I would use canned or lemongrass hearts as the middles can be hard to chop when fresh or frozen.

**Garnish**

-   Bunch coriander
-   Bunch mint leaves
-   4 tablespoons crushed roasted peanuts

## (1) Make the dipping sauce

Grab the following ingredients:

-   4 tablespoons light brown sugar
-   3 tablespoons rice vinegar
-   4 tablespoons lime juice (from two large limes, or use bottled)
-   4 tablespoons fish sauce[^3]
-   2 garlic cloves - minced
-   3 cm piece of ginger - peeled and minced
-   2 chillies - chopped

[^3]: Use good quality fish sauce. In Australia, I prefer Squid or Red Boat. See [this blog post](https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/fish-sauce-101/) for what makes a good good fish sauce.

## (2) Prep the noodles

Whilst the sauce is marinating, let's prepare the noodles. Grab the noodles:

-   340 g rice vermicelli noodles

## (3) Prep the beef

Whilst the noodle cools down, we'll prepare the beef. Grab the following:

-   500 g beef - sliced thinly (less than 1 cm thick)
-   2 tablespoons fish sauce
-   1 tablespoon light brown sugar
-   3 garlic cloves - minced
-   80g lemongrass paste or 3 tablespoons lemongrass - tender centres finely chopped[^4]

[^4]: I would use canned or lemongrass hearts as the middles can be hard to chop when fresh or frozen.

## (4) Prep salad

Whilst the beef is marinating, we'll prepare the salad. Grab the salad ingredients:

-   1 head lettuce - yummy leaves washed and separated
-   1 medium carrot - cut and julienned[^5]
-   1 small cucumber - cut and julienned
-   1 daikon radish - cut and julienned
-   A handful of bean sprouts

[^5]: In other words, matchsticks. For instructions, see this Serious Eats [guide](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-cut-carrots-7963002#toc-to-cut-matchsticksjulienne).

## (5) Stir-fry beef

Let's stir-fry the beef now. Grab the following:

-   Marinated beef from Section 3 above
-   Vegetable oil - for stir-frying

## (6) All together, now

Now, to put them all together.

-   Bunch coriander
-   Bunch mint leaves
-   4 tablespoons crushed roasted peanuts

## Notes

I also like to substitute chicken or pork, cooked in a similar way. I haven't figured out how to substitute with tofu.

The name for this salad is Bun Bo Xao.
