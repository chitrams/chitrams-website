I am a medical statistician and researcher with interests in epidemiology, climate change, and public health. More generally, I am interested in finding ways to be better at cooking, baking, learning, note-taking, writing, yoga, statistical programming, and understanding other people.

I find that writing organises my thoughts, and writing as if other people are going to read what you're writing is the next level up. So here I am with a website.
