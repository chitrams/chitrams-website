### About me

I am a medical statistician and researcher with interests in epidemiology, climate change, and public health. The common thread in my professional career is leveraging data, mathematical modelling, and high-performance computing for some of the world's most urgent health challenges.

I am also interested in cooking, baking, learning, writing, yoga, statistical programming, and playing the piano. I also find the field of psychology incredibly fascinating. These are all topics I would write about in this blog, under the heading [**Curation**](https://chitra-ms.com/curation/).

I find that [writing leads to understanding](https://paulgraham.com/words.html), and writing for others is the next level up. So here I am with a [digital garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/)-kind of website.
