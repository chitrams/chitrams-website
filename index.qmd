I write about things I find interesting so my future self can find them more easily. Subjects within this curation include (but are not limited to):

-   interesting problems in statistics, data science, and/or statistical programming,
-   resources to become a better statistician and/or programmer,
-   recipes that I refer to over and over again, and
-   resources for self-improvement and wellness that I've found personally useful, such as:
    -   learning how to learn,
    -   how to be a better writer,
    -   yoga,
    -   concepts from psychotherapy, and
    -   social psychology.
