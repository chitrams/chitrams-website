This website is a curation of resources I've found useful and would like to refer to at a later date--ideally with a write-up of how I've found it useful.

I am a medical statistician and researcher with research interests in climate change and public health. More generally, I am interested in finding ways to be better at writing, cooking, calligraphy, learning, note-taking, yoga, and understanding other people.
