    "title": "R packages for summary tables in Word",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A big part of what I do day-to-day is to provide a report of summary statistics. The researchers I work with would usually want this report in the format of a Word document (.docx) as it is (unfortunately) still the most widely used word processing software.\nI much prefer markdown and TeX files for reports, but you have to work to your audience. This is how I went down the rabbit hole of trying to find an R package that outputs summary tables into Word documents. So far I’ve found that gtsummary and table1 combined with the flextable package does the job best.\nAnother package that’s been brought to my attention is stargazer, but alas it only outputs to html. So I’ll walk you through a reproducible example of how to use the gtsummary and table1 packages to create aesthetically pleasing summary tables in Word, supported by the flextable package.\n\nUsing gtsummary\nLet’s create a table for the mtcars data, grouping by engine type (V-shaped vs straight). Here’s how we’d do it using the gtsummary package:\n\nlibrary(gtsummary)\n\nmtcars %&gt;%\n  select(mpg, cyl, disp, am, vs) %&gt;% \n  tbl_summary(by = vs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\n0, N = 181\n1, N = 141\n\n\n\n\nmpg\n15.7 (14.8, 19.1)\n22.8 (21.4, 29.6)\n\n\ncyl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    4\n1 (5.6%)\n10 (71%)\n\n\n    6\n3 (17%)\n4 (29%)\n\n\n    8\n14 (78%)\n0 (0%)\n\n\ndisp\n311 (276, 360)\n121 (83, 162)\n\n\nam\n6 (33%)\n7 (50%)\n\n\n\n1 Median (IQR); n (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot bad–and it plays well with the tidyverse. I also like that gtsummary tends to be smart about how the results should be displayed. For example, the cyl and am variables were automatically treated as discrete instead of continuous variables (thus giving us counts and percentages instead of median and IQR). You’ll notice that if you have the levels of a categorical variable as 0 and 1 (as in am), gtsummary provides only the count and percentage for the values coded as 1, which I’d argue eliminates redundancy.\n\n\nUsing table1\nNow, let’s use the table1 package:\n\nlibrary(table1)\n\ntable1(~ mpg + factor(cyl) + disp + factor(am) | factor(vs),\n       data = mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n(N=18)\n1\n(N=14)\nOverall\n(N=32)\n\n\n\n\nmpg\n\n\n\n\n\nMean (SD)\n16.6 (3.86)\n24.6 (5.38)\n20.1 (6.03)\n\n\nMedian [Min, Max]\n15.7 [10.4, 26.0]\n22.8 [17.8, 33.9]\n19.2 [10.4, 33.9]\n\n\nfactor(cyl)\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n1 (5.6%)\n10 (71.4%)\n11 (34.4%)\n\n\n6\n3 (16.7%)\n4 (28.6%)\n7 (21.9%)\n\n\n8\n14 (77.8%)\n0 (0%)\n14 (43.8%)\n\n\ndisp\n\n\n\n\n\nMean (SD)\n307 (107)\n132 (56.9)\n231 (124)\n\n\nMedian [Min, Max]\n311 [120, 472]\n121 [71.1, 258]\n196 [71.1, 472]\n\n\nfactor(am)\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n12 (66.7%)\n7 (50.0%)\n19 (59.4%)\n\n\n1\n6 (33.3%)\n7 (50.0%)\n13 (40.6%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne could argue that the formula format is a bit tedious as you can’t select the variables (for example, from a list or vector), but I find that you usually need to be cognisant of which variables you want included in a summary table anyways so this isn’t much of a problem for me. I also prefer how it looks as it fits more into the format of a ‘Table 1’ for scientific publishing (hence the package name).\nI did however have to wrap the cyl and am with factor() as table1 does not automatically treat these numeric variables as categorical variables.\n\n\nExporting using flextable\nNow let’s export these tables into Word. First you have to save your table as a flextable object. You do this by either using the as_flex_table() function for a gtsummary object, or the t1flex() function for a table1 object. Once you’ve done that, save_as_docx() saves the table into a Word document which you can copy and paste. Here’s how it would look:\n\n# For gtsummary\ntable &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%\n  select(mpg, cyl, disp, am, vs) %&gt;% \n  tbl_summary(by = vs)\n\nas_flex_table(table) %&gt;% \n  save_as_docx(path = \"./gtsummary.docx\")\n\n# For table1\ntable &lt;- table1(~ mpg + factor(cyl) + disp + factor(am) | factor(vs),\n       data = mtcars)\n\nt1flex(table) %&gt;% \n  save_as_docx(path = \"./table1.docx\")\n\nflextable also supports exporting to HTML, PDF, and PowerPoint documents; it also supports rendering tables as graphic files (such as png and jpeg).\n\n\nAdditional notes\nYou can add content to Word and PowerPoint documents using the officer package, but I haven’t used it before–my end users usually just copy-and-paste the tables. This is a package I’d like to look into."

    "title": "Functional programming",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I was recommended Hadley Wickham’s talk The Joy of Functional Programming (for Data Science) when I was struggling to code some iterative processes (you can find his talk on YouTube). The issue I ran into was trying to run row-wise and column-wise functions using for loops in R (a kerfuffle I’ll document in another blog post), which can get quite nasty with nested for loops.\nThe main lesson I learnt from the talk is: some clever programmers have wrapped up for loops in a function, map, that makes writing and reading code so much easier. It takes a while to get used to implementing these functions, but I can already say (in my very short two weeks of using it) that it’s a game-changer for my workflow. I think the main advantage of using map (and its cousins, which you can explore from the purrr package) is that it allow us to focus on both the action and the object whilst programming. In comparison, whilst using for loops I find myself focusing more on the object and the action can get lost. Here’s an example to show you what I mean:\n# For loop approach:\nout1 &lt;- vector(\"double\", ncol(mtcars))\nfor (i in seq_along(mtcars)) {\n  out1[[i]] &lt;- mean(mtcars[[i]], na.rm = TRUE)\n}\n\nout2 &lt;- vector(\"double\", ncol(mtcars))\nfor (i in seq_along(mtcars)) {\n  out2[[i]] &lt;- median(mtcars[[i]], na.rm = TRUE)\n}\n\n# Functional programming approach:\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nout1 &lt;- map_dbl(mtcars, mean, na.rm = TRUE)\nout2 &lt;- mtcars %&gt;% map_dbl(median, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Where map_dbl is an extension of map, returning\n# a vector in double ('dbl') type.\nYou only figure out which actions we’re taking (calculating the mean and median) a few lines down the for loop, after the object has been defined. There is also more room for error as we have to define the object before we run the action every time (i.e. creating the vector and sequencing along each column before calculating the mean and median). The functional programming approach is more concise. You can also see that map plays well with the pipe.\nSomething to note: in the example above, we use map_dbl instead of just map. This is one of the many extensions to the map function; there is also map_chr to return character-type lists.\nI also find the following figure handy to understand how the map functions work:\n\n\n\nThe map function in R. Figure from Hadley Wickham’s Advanced R.\n\n\nAnother thing to note is there are several ways of writing out the same thing using map. In the following bit of code you’ll find four different ways of writing out the same function: finding the number of unique values in each column of the mtcars dataset.\nmap_dbl(mtcars, function(x) length(unique(x)))\n\nmap_dbl(mtcars, ~ length(unique(.x)))\n\nmap_dbl(\n  .x = mtcars,\n  .f = length(unique(.x))\n)\n\nmap_dbl(\n  .x = mtcars,\n  .f = \\(x) length(unique(x))\n)\n\n# All three above returns:\n#&gt; mpg  cyl disp   hp drat   wt qsec   vs   am gear carb \n#&gt;  25    3   27   22   22   29   30    2    2    3    6\nIt took me a while to figure out when I needed to add a dot to the variable (.x)–and to be honest, I still haven’t gotten to the bottom of why we sometimes need to prefix x with a dot (and sometimes not).\nHere’s another simple example, with an equivalent in lapply:\nmap(paths, ~ read.csv(.x))\n\n# Equivalent to the following:\nlapply(paths, function(x) read.csv(x))\nConcise and easy to read.\nThe main issue I had with learning this concept was the steep learning curve. You have to put quite a bit of time into learning which functions are available in the purrr package. I still struggle with figuring out which function I should use and how I should write out the program. But as with most R packages, there are good resources out there that explains these functions really well. So despite the difficulties, I’ll be replacing most of my for loops with map.\n\nUseful links for further reading:\n\nYou can find the purrr website here.\npurrr has a cheat sheet (released by RStudio) here.\nHadley Wickham gives a good explanation of this in Section 9.2 of his Advanced R textbook."

    "text": "Git is one of those things that I’ve always known I should learn how to use as a statistician, but never got around to actually learning–my exsiting workflow was working well enough that I couldn’t justify putting the effort into learning it. It was unattractive mainly because it’s a steep learning curve, as you need to learn a different way of thinking about managing your digital workflow. It also doesn’t help that the official documentation is difficult to navigate. So I completely understand why a lot of statisticians and researchers I know aren’t super keen to learn how to use Git and version control.\nI’ve changed my tune now because work has necessitated the use of version control: collaborative software development requires other people to see what you’ve been up to. From that, I’ve been pleasantly surprised to find that using Git is also useful for my own personal projects–yes, even when I’m the only person working on it. I hope I can show you how I’ve found Git helpful and which resources have helped me out most in learning how to use it.\nI also came across the issue of struggling to set Git up in RStudio as I don’t have admin rights on my work PC, which runs Windows. So if you’re running into that issue as well, I’ve written down what’s worked for me.\n\nWhy use Git?\nThe biggest reason I’ve loved using Git as a statistician is the ability to change my analysis without being confused about which parts of the analysis I’ve changed. Following from this, if something breaks, I can simply revert to the previous working version. Let me explain.\nSay I have a workflow that looks like this:\n\n Read in data\n Generate summary table for data\n Fit two models to data\n Generate tables of model coefficients\n Put all tables in a report: a .Rmd file\n\nEverything’s working, all tables look pretty, and this is all saved in the main branch.\nNow, say that I’ve decided to make the tables in Step 2 look even prettier. I’ll create a new branch called prettier-tables where I’ll play around with the code. Then I find that I don’t really understand how to work the new package I’m using for making the prettier tables, and two of the steps break:\n\n Read in data\n Generate summary table for data\n Fit two models to data\n Generate tables of model coefficients\n Put all tables in a report: a .Rmd file\n\nThe deadline’s looming, my supervisor asks me to re-fit one of the models, and tells me we don’t need prettier tables. I re-fit the model, which is an easy update and works fine, but the report isn’t rendering because I screwed something up in Step 2–and I’m not sure which bits of my code are failing.\nThis is where Git comes in: I can go back to the main branch when everything was working just fine and abandon the prettier-tables branch. Then I can make my model changes and render my report with the updates. This is especially useful in situtations where you have to figure out which parts of your code you’ve changed and which ones you haven’t, and subsequently change back the edited bits. You don’t have to think about which bits to change, and worry about whether you’ve missed something–you can simply switch branches with one button in RStudio! It’s far less stressful this way.\n\n\nResources to learn Git\nSo how is it that I’ve learnt to use Git? I think what’s worked best for me so far is forcing myself to put an existing workflow on to a GitHub repository and making sure that I always use version control. It helps as well that I’m collaborating with people who use Git day-to-day, so I can ask them questions when I get stuck on a particular thing. I think the hardest thing about learning Git is how inscrutable the technical language is when you’re first starting out. On that note, I’ve found Stack Exchange and ChatGPT really useful: they are places where you can translate technical Git language into plain English. ChatGPT is especially useful if you’re learning Git on your own and don’t have other people you can ask your questions to.\nI’ve found the following resources incredibly useful:\n\nHappy Git and GitHub for the useR. This resource is specific to using Git and GitHub within RStudio. Incredibly beginner-friendly.\nAn interactive tutorial: Learn Git Branching. Great for visualising Git concepts.\nOh Shit, Git!?! is a great website that helps you troubleshoot errors in plain English.\n\nAnd once I was on top of the above resources and wanted to have a deeper dive into Git, I found the following resources really useful:\n\nVersion Control with Git (Second Edition) by Jon Loeliger and Matthew McCullough. It’s not open source and is published by O’Reilly (book website here). I’d only read this once you’re pretty comfortable with using Git, and if you’re interested in understanding what happens underneath the surface. You don’t need to read this to be able to use Git but I’ve found it interesting, and the writing engaging.\nPro Git by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, available here. This is a popular open source textbook for Git and I’ve found it useful, but I think it only starts making sense once you have the fundamental understanding of Git. In other words, I couldn’t just pick it up and start reading it when I was first trying to figure Git out.\n\n\n\nAdmin rights issues on Windows\nI came across this issue when I was trying to set up Git on my work computer, which runs Windows and which I don’t have admin rights to. After I’ve downloaded and installed Git for Windows, I found that RStudio was struggling to “find” the Git executable. To solve this, I manually changed the path for my Git installation. I did this by:\n\ngo to Control panel &gt; Edit environment variables for your account,\nselect ‘Path’,\nclick the ‘Edit’ button and add the path for your Git installation.\n\nSo my understanding of why this happens is: when you don’t have admin rights on Windows, your computer only installs Git for your user directory, but RStudio tries to find the path to your Git executable at the system-wide level instead of within your user-specific directory. Which means you have to point to that path yourself.\nAnother tweak I did that I think helped make it work was to use SSH instead of HTTPS. I’m not sure how exactly that would have helped, but Git started working after I made that change. Or maybe it’s because I restarted the RStudio session; who knows? (If anyone understands why this would have helped, I would love an explanation.)\n\n\nConclusion\nSo all this to say that I’ve learnt how to Git good (with R!) and I hope the list of resources is useful for your own Git journey. I think the main takeaways are to actually use Git with your project and figure out how Git is useful for you. Once you convince yourself that Git is useful for your workflow, it gets a lot easier to learn."

When the oil is hot, add the whites of the spring onions and stir until they turn translucent, about 1-2 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger next and stir until fragrant.\nTurn heat to low and add the chicken stock. Turn the heat back up to medium-high until the chicken stock bubbles. Once it bubbles, turn heat down until it stays at a gentle simmer.\nAdd the whole sweet corn, blended sweet corn, carrots, and chicken.\nCook until the soup returns to a gentle simmer and the chicken pieces are cooked. Top up with water as needed if you feel that the soupr has reduced too much. Adjust flavour to taste with soy sauce and salt, adding as much as you think you need.\nTo add the egg-drop streaks, nsure your soup is still at a gentle simmer, about medium-high heat. Whisk the eggs in a separate bowl, adding a dash of soy sauce and a pinch of salt. EHold the bowl with one hand and with your other hand, stir the soup in one direction–say clockwise–until the liquid becomes like a whirlpool. Whilst stirring, add the eggs to outer edges of the pan so it gets swirled in the whirlpool. Continue stirring until you’ve added all your eggs.\nAdd the pinch of white pepper and adjust the flavours with salt and soy sauce, adding as much as you think it needs. I prefer the soup to be savoury with a little bit of salty, balancing it with the sweetness of the corn.\nWhen you are happy with the flavour, whisk the cornstarch with cold water in a small bowl. Add this mixture to the soup whilst stirring, and allow the soup to come back to a boil. If the soup is still too think, add more cornstarch slurry to the soup, making sure you are continuously stirring the soup to avoid clumping.\nOnce you are happy with the thickness, take the soup off the heat and add a dash of sesame oil, stirring it in. Garnish with the sliced greens of the spring onions and serve immediately.\n\nNotes\nIf you’re going to freeze or refrigirate the soup, wait until you are reheating the soup before adding in the cornstarch slurry."

    "text": "It’s interesting how the internet is such a big part of our lives, but less than 24 hours ago I couldn’t tell you what it was, exactly. And I think most people are in this same position. You have a general idea of how the internet works as it relates to you, but you don’t bother diving into the details–just like how you don’t need to understand how an engine works to drive a car. But then I came across an issue that needed me to dive deeper into how the system works, so here is a list of excellent resources that I’ve found helpful.\nFor context, I was (and am still) struggling with adding subdomains to this website and getting each page to correctly link to a subdomain. I would like, for example, for chitra-ms.com/code-collection/ to have the URL code.chitra-ms.com instead. I still haven’t figured out how exactly to go about this, but I ended up going into the following rabbit holes:\nIt’s been a fascinating journey.\nI found that there are a lot of resources out there to learn web development. MOOCs on Coursera and edX; standalone sites such as Codecademy and freeCodeCamp. What I’ve found learning on these platforms, though, is that I end up not learning very much and get frustrated easily. I thought it was the gamification and oversimplification that I found annoying. But then I came across a blog post by Andrew Latta (on Medium, Archive.org) that clearly explains why the journey of learning to code can be so frustrating and explains why these resources aren’t that great once you get to a certain level.\nEnter The Odin Project. This is a different way of learning to program that’s more holistic and teaches you to make your own projects instead of over-simplifying and gamifying your code. It’s excellent for learning about web development and gives you context for why you’re learning the things you’re learning too.\nI continued my web-surfing from The Odin Project to find the following excellent resources on the topic. They’re all clearly written and give excellent explanations. I know I’m using “excellent” a lot, but I really am blown by how well these resources were written and organised–and that we all have free access to these quality resources."

    "text": "I’m currently learning how to run an R workflow on a supercomputer. I’ve never come across supercomputers before and didn’t even know how and where to start. It’s been quite the journey and I thought I’d compile this list of resources so anyone else who wants to learn how to use supercomputers can have a friendly guide to get them started.\nBefore I dive into it, I would like to distinguish between using supercomputers and high-performance computing (HPC). These terms (“supercomputing” and “HPC”) are often used interchangeably, as you will see me do in this post, but there is a distinction here in the context of advanced computing. Supercomputers are only a subset of HPCs. HPC is a broader term that encompasses the use of supercomputers and other powerful computing resources to solve advanced computational problems.\nThe following is an opinionated list of what I believe to be the most important concepts to learn when you’re first starting out with HPC. Of course, you can run programs on high-performance computers without necessarily needing to understand the following concepts, especially if you’ve been given pre-written scripts to run your programs. However, I still think it’s helpful to understand the following concepts if you’d like to optimise your HPC usage."

When you’re on the command line, you also want to be able to use text editors like Vim or Nano to edit scripts and configuration files.\nThe textbooks I most enjoyed using were Bash and Linux and the command line. They give accessible explanations of what’s going on.\nHere are the resources I found useful for quickly learning Vim: - A quick introduction to what’s going on when you really have no clue: this guide from the Linux Handbook. - An interactive tutorial for learning Vim: OpenVim. I liked this because it allows you to actually see what happens on the screen as you’re typing things out. - Otherwise you could try out the built-in vimtutor by typing in vimtutor in your terminal (assuming Vim is already installed on your device). - For information on how to do more advanced things in Vim, this guide is pretty good."

It’s nothing too complicated, but it is complex: if one part changes, the rest of the project changes too.\nFor example, perhaps the data is updated and we want to re-run the whole analysis from start to finish. Or perhaps we decide that the model isn’t a good fit, so we fit a few other models and see which one is better; in this instance, only the model, plot, and table would change, but the rest of the project stays the same.\nAll this is fine if you have well-annotated code and know which parts of the script to re-run. But what if you accidentally run the wrong parts of the script that are computationally intensive and time-consuming? Or what if it takes a while to re-render your table because you’ve included so many variables, and you really didn’t have to because you only wanted the plot and not the table? Or even if you’re just tweaking a few variables and then making a plot: if you miss re-naming a variable earlier on in your script, your plot might not be generated correctly because it depends on that variable.\nIt’s in situations like these where {targets} can help you. Using a targets workflow means you’ll have it all laid out in front of you instead of needing to look for specific bits of code in your script and any dependencies. It’ll take the headache out of figuring out which parts of the analysis depends on which variables and functions. Then when you change a variable name (or any part of the project, really), you’ll know which parts of the analysis would need to be re-run, minus the headaches.\nTo summarise, I find a targets workflow especially useful in the following scenarios:\n\nif you’re doing something complex that has a lot of moving parts;\nif said moving parts will change as your project progresses; and/or\nif you’d like to re-run your analysis with different inputs (e.g. a new dataset), or to create different outputs (e.g. plots and tables)—especially if you’re re-running your analysis a lot!"

    "text": "How to use targets\nWhen you’re first starting to program in R—especially if you’re mainly doing statistical analysis—a targets workflow might seem an unnecessarily complex way of going about things. When I first came across the targets workflow, I felt overwhelmed and didn’t understand how it could be useful for my workflow. So the way I’d recommend going about it is to take an existing project, and to convert the scripts in that project into a targets workflow.\nThe quick walkthrough in the user manual is an excellent example of how to use the targets workflow–I highly recommend reading it and going through the worked example. It does a much better job than I can in giving a reproducible example of how to use targets. Then I recommend converting your project to a targets workflow by using that walkthrough, or this quick tutorial.\nI’ll walk you through a conceptual overview of how I use targets. However, I highly recommend you first work through the two tutorials above."

    "text": "An example workflow\nSo you can follow along, I’ve created a repo that demos a simple targets workflow here.\nFirst, I make sure that I understand my workflow from beginning to end. This overview is the main advantage of using a targets workflow: you’ll have a bird’s eye view of your analysis and figure out where changes are necessary. In this example, I’ve broken down my analysis to the following steps:\n\nread in csv file of data;\nsummarise data and generate a table;\nfit models; and finally,\ngenerate a plot of the data and fitted model.\n\nOnce I’ve done that and would like to start creating a targets workflow, I’ll run the following in my console:\n\nlibrary(targets)\nlibrary(tarchetypes)\n\ntar_script()\n\nThis creates a file in your project directory called _targets.R. This is the high-level overview of the project, so I open that and write out something like the following:\n\n# _targets.R file\n\n# Set-up ------------------------------\n\nlibrary(targets)\nlibrary(tarchetypes)\n\n# Load packages needed for this project\ntar_option_set(\n  packages = c(\"tidyverse\",\n               \"purrr\")\n  )\n\n# Set up a workspace when our code errors\ntar_option_set(workspace_on_error = TRUE)\n\n# Load functions to be used in our project\nsource(\"R/functions.R\")\n\n# Target objects ------------------------------\n\ntar_plan(\n  \n  # Load data\n  tar_file(\n    path_to_data,\n    \"./raw/data.csv\"\n    ),\n    \n  tar_target(\n    data,\n    read_csv(path_to_data)\n  ),\n  \n  # Create a summary table\n  tar_target(\n    data_summary_table,\n    summarise_data(data)\n  ),\n  \n  # Fit a model to the data\n  tar_target(\n    model,\n    model_data(data)\n  ),\n  \n  # Create plot of the data and fitted model\n  tar_target(\n    plot,\n    plot_data_with_model(data)\n  ),\n\n  # Create table of model coefficients\n  tar_target(\n    table_of_model,\n    tabulate_model(model)\n  )\n  \n)\n\nWhere summary_table, model_data, plot_data, and table_of_model are functions I’ve written up myself and saved in a separate script called functions.R.\nThe advantage of this workflow is you can change the one part that need changing in your workflow, and the {targets} package will change the rest for you. I can’t emphasise how life-changing this was for me.\nHere’s an example. If your data changes, you just need to change the first target object path_to_data to point to the new data file. You can then re-run the whole analysis using tar_make() and your resulting summary table, fitted model, plot, and table of model coefficients will be re-created with the new data you’ve pointed to. This is so much easier than having a script and needing to change data to new_data for every instance in which it’s referred to, or by re-running the whole script yourself. How convenient is that?\nYou can also have an overview of your workflow and what needs to be updated by running tar_visnetwork()."

If you’re trained as a statistical programmer, I assume you’re used to writing your code in scripts. A targets workflow requires you to write your code as functions instead (otherwise known as “functional programming”).\nIt is a steep learning curve and it did take me a while to get my head around why and how I should use a targets workflow. It’s a different way of thinking about how to program.\nDespite this, I do highly recommend using a targets workflow instead of having multiple R scripts, for all the reasons I’ve stated above. Utilising this workflow is a step towards reproducible research, which is always great."

When you’re on the command line, you also want to be able to use text editors like Vim or Nano to edit scripts and configuration files.\nThe textbook I enjoyed most for this was The Linux Command Line by William Shotts (freely available here). It gives an accessible and friendly explanation of what’s going on.\nMy preferred text editor is Vim. Here are the resources I found most helpful in learning how to use Vim:\n\nA quick introduction to what’s going on when you really have no clue: this guide from the Linux Handbook.\nAn interactive tutorial for learning Vim: OpenVim. I liked this because it allows you to actually see what happens on the screen as you’re typing things out. I preferred this over the game Vim Adventures as 1) you can clearly see the progression of what you’re learning; and 2) it’s free.\nOtherwise you could try out the built-in vimtutor by typing in vimtutor in your terminal (assuming Vim is already installed on your device).\nFor information on how to do more advanced things in Vim, this guide is pretty good.\n\n\n\nHPC components\nIt’s important to understand the components of the supercomputer you’re using so that you have a general idea of how processes and data move between its components. As an example, the following is a simplified and generalised architecture of a supercomputer, courtesy of Pawsey (Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre 2023).\n\n\n\nGeneral architecture of a supercomputer.\n\n\nIt’s useful to understand how to access the compute nodes and storage nodes from the login node; how to move data to and from the storage system from your local computer; and how to use the job scheduling system, which is the next topic.\n\n\nJob scheduling system (Slurm)\nSlurm is the most widely used job scheduling system for HPC clusters, but there are other job schedulers used too. Familiarise yourself with them.\nI found this to be a good guide to Slurm.\n\n\nComputer architecture\nThe best way to understand how supercomputers work is to understand how computers work to begin with, including computer architecture and computer networks. Specifically, I would want to know how processors, memory, and storage components work.\nI’ll write separate posts on these topics and link them here.\n\n\nNetworking concepts\nSpecifically, a basic understanding of how to use SSH for secure remote access and data transfer.\nFor file transfer tools specifically, I found it useful to understand how to use tools such as scp, sftp, or rsync for transferring data into and out of the HPC system."

I only compiled this list after having spent over a month–every day–reading up and watching videos on how to use supercomputers.\nWhat you could do is go to your supercomputer centre’s help page and see if they have user documentation that you can use and a support team you can reach out to. Pawsey, the supercomputing research centre I’m with, has an excellent and comprehensive user support documentation, a Supercomputing User Training playlist, and a responsive support team who helps us optimise our workflow. At one point I just needed to talk to someone and ask for help, so it was really good to have access to the support team.\nI also think it’s helpful to simply talk to someone who’s used supercomputers before. That way you can: 1) have a general idea of what you need to do, tailored to your workflow; and 2) have it pointed out to you what you don’t know about supercomputers. I found it really helpful to chat with colleagues who have worked with supercomputers. Alternatively, drop me a line and I will do my best to help!"

Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, frequently swirling the pan gently, until particles begin to turn golden brown and butter smells nutty, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and continue swirling the pan until the butter is a rich brown, about 15 seconds longer. Transfer to a small bowl and whisk in the ice cubes. Then transfer the bowl to refrigerator and allow to cool completely, for about 20 minutes, whisking occasionally.\nNow combine flour, baking soda, and salt in the medium bowl. Whisk until ingredients are combined. Set aside.\nRoughly chop up the dark chocolate if you haven’t done so already. Set aside.\nIn the large bowl, mix together granulated sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract on medium-high speed until mixture is pale brownish-yellow and falls off the whisk in thick ribbons when lifted, about 5 minutes.\nFit paddle attachment onto mixer. When brown butter mixture has cooled (it should be just starting to turn opaque again and firm around the edges), add brown sugar and cooled brown butter to the sugar and egg mixture. Mix on medium speed to combine, about 30 seconds, being careful not to overmix.\nAdd flour mixture to the liquids and mix together using a wooden spoon until barely combined, with some dry flour still remaining. Add chocolate and mix until dough comes together.\nTransfer dough to an airtight container and refrigerate for at least a few hours and up to 3 days.\nWhen ready to bake, pre-heat oven to 160ºC. Line baking tray with baking paper. Roll dough into balls about 25 g each and place them 5 cm apart on the baking tray, as they will expand when baking. Lightly flattening the balls with your fingers. Bake for 12-15 minutes until golden brown.\nOnce removed from oven, let cool on the trays for at least five minutes so it has time to firm up. Transfer to a wire rack or eat immediately.\nThese cookies store well in an air-tight container for up to one week."
