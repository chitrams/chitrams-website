    "text": "Adapted from Snacking Cakes by Yossy Arefi\nIngredients\n\n95g all-purpose flour\n65g whole wheat flour1\n1.5 teaspoons baking powder\n0.5 teaspoons bicarb soda\n85g sugar\n2 large eggs\n155g neutral oil2\n2 teaspoons ground cardamom\n2 teaspoons ground cinnamon\n1 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n225g peeled and grated carrots3\n60g chopped pitted dates\n75g chopped toasted pecans4\n\nMethod\n\nPreheat oven to 175°C fan-forced. Butter or coat an 8in/20x20cm baking pan5 with non-stick spray. Line pan with a strip of parchment paper that hangs over two of the edges.\nIn a medium-sized bowl, sift all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, and bicarb soda. Whisk or mix until well-distributed.\nIn a separate medium-sized bowl, add sugar and eggs. Whisk or mix the mixture until pale and foamy (1m by hand, ~15s by electric mixer; careful not to overmix). Add oil, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Continue whisking/mixing until smooth and emulsified.\nAdd dry ingredients to the liquid mixture. Whisk (or use rubber spatula to mix) until well-combined and smooth. Then use rubber spatula to fold in grated carrots, dates, and pecans.\nPour batter into prepared pan. Tap pan gently to release any air bubbles and smooth top of batter.\nBake cake in middle rack of oven until puffed and golden and tester/skewer/butter knife inserted into the center comes out clean–30-40m. Set pan on a rack to cool for ~15m then use the parchment paper to lift the cake out of the pan and set it on the rack to cool completely.\nStore the cake, well-wrapped, at room temperature for up to 3d. Freezes well too."

Makes about a dozen larger cookies, or 20 smaller cookies.\nIngredients\n\n1-2 very ripe medium banana\n70g canola oil\n100g sugar\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n115g all purpose flour\n0.5 teaspoon baking soda\n0.25 teaspoon salt\n0.25 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n160g rolled oats\n65g toasted chopped walnuts or pecans\n85g chocolate cut up into chunks, or chocolate chips (ideally these would be vegan)\n\nMethod\n\nPreheat oven to 180C. Lightly spray two baking sheets with oil, or line with parchment paper.\nIn a mixing bowl, mash banana(s) well.\nAdd oil, sugar, and vanilla, and mix.\nAdd flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Mix until just moistened.\nAdd oatmeal, walnuts, and chocolate chips. Using your hands or a spoon, mix well, ensuring oats are well-moistened. If dough is very slippery, add a little bit more flour.\nUsing clean, wet hands, roll dough into balls slightly smaller than a golf ball (about 3cm in diameter). Flatten slightly and place 5 cm apart on baking sheet.\nBake until lightly browned, 10-12 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool for two minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.\n\n\nNotes\nAs I’m not vegan, I prefer recipes that don’t rely on egg replacement products such as flaxseed.\nOther books I’d like to read about vegan baking:\n\nVegan cupcakes take over the world (goodreads)\nThe joy of vegan baking (goodreads)"
