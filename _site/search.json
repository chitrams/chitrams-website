    "title": "Understanding a targets workflow",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I was recently introduced to the R package targets as part of learning how to develop software. As I continue to use it, I’ve been blown away by how much easier my workflow has become--even outside of software development--and I regret not having known of it sooner. It would have been nice to use this workflow when I was doing my Master’s thesis, which involved a large amount of complex and repeated analyses. So here’s my notes on the targets workflow so far: why use it, how to use it (especially if you’ve never used it before), and the resources I found most useful.\n\nWhy use a targets workflow?\nMost of us doing statistical analysis work on complex projects with moving parts. What I mean by this is: say I have a workflow that involves loading the data, some exploratory data analysis, fitting the data to a model, visualising it, and then creating a summary table of the data. It’s nothing too complicated, but it is complex: if one part changes, the rest of the project changes too.\nFor example, perhaps the data is updated and we want to re-run the whole analysis from start to finish. Or perhaps we decide that the model isn’t a good fit, so we run some other models and see which one is better; in this instance, only the model and visualisation would change, but the rest of the project stays the same.\nAll this is fine if you have well-annotated code and know which parts of the script to re-run. But what if the computations are intensive and time-consuming? Or what if it takes a while to render your table because you’ve included so many variables? Or even if you’re just tweaking a few variables and then making a plot; if you miss re-naming a variable earlier on in your script, your plot might not run because it depends on that variable.\nIt’s in situations like these where targets can help you. Using a targets workflow means you’ll have it all laid out in front of you instead of needing to look for specific bits of code in your script and any dependencies. It’ll take the headache out of figuring out which parts of the analysis depends on which variables and functions. Then when you change a variable name (or any part of the project, really), you’ll know which parts of the analysis would need to be re-run, minus the headaches.\nTo summarise, I find a targets workflow especially useful in the following scenarios:\n\nIf you’re doing something complex that has a lot of moving parts\nIf said moving parts will change as your project progresses\nIf you’d like to re-run your analysis with different inputs (e.g. a new dataset), or to create different outputs (e.g. plots and tables); especially if you’re re-running your analysis a lot!\n\n\n\nHow to use targets\nWhen you’re first starting to program in R–especially if you’re mainly doing statistical analysis–a targets workflow might seem an unnecessary way of going about things. When I first came across the targets workflow, I felt overwhelmed and didn’t understand how it could be useful for my workflow. So the way I’d recommend going about it is to take an existing project and to convert that to a targets workflow.\nThe quick walkthrough in the user manual is an excellent example of how to use the targets workflow–I highly recommend reading it and going through the worked example. It does a much better job than I can in giving a reproducible example of how to use targets. Then I recommend converting your project to a targets workflow by using that walkthrough, or this quick tutorial.\nI’ll walk you through a conceptual overview of how I use targets. I highly recommend you work through the two tutorials above first, though.\nFirst I make sure that I understand my workflow from beginning to end. This overview is the main advantage of using a targets workflow: you’ll have a bird’s eye view of your analysis and figure out where changes are necessary. For example, I may break down my analysis like this:\n\nRead in csv file of data\nSummarise data\nFit a model to the data\nCreate a plot of the model\n\nOnce I’ve done that and would like to start creating a targets workflow, I’ll run the following in my console:\n\nlibrary(targets)\nlibrary(tarchetypes)\n\ntar_script()\n\nThis creates a file in your project directory called _targets.R. This is the high-level overview of the project, so I open that and write out something like the following:\n\n# _targets.R file\n\n# Set-up ------------------------------\n\nlibrary(targets)\nlibrary(tarchetypes)\n\n# Load packages needed for this project\ntar_option_set(\n  packages = c(\"tidyverse\",\n               \"purrr\")\n  )\n\n# Set up a workspace when our code errors\ntar_option_set(workspace_on_error = TRUE)\n\n# Load functions to be used in our project\nsource(\"R/functions.R\")\n\n# Target objects ------------------------------\n\ntar_plan(\n  \n  # Load data\n  tar_file(\n    path_to_data,\n    \"./raw/data.csv\"\n    ),\n    \n  tar_target(\n    data,\n    read_csv(path_to_data)\n  ),\n  \n  # Create a summary table\n  tar_target(\n    summary_table,\n    summarise_data(data)\n  ),\n  \n  # Fit a model to the data\n  tar_target(\n    model,\n    model_data(data)\n  ),\n  \n  # Create plot of the data\n  tar_target(\n    plot,\n    plot_data(data)\n  )\n  \n)\n\nWhere summary_table, model_data, and plot_data are functions I’ve written up myself and saved in a separate script called functions.R.\nThe advantage of the above is if your data changes, as an example, you just need to change the first target object path_to_data to point to the new data file. You can then re-run the whole analysis using tar_make() and your resulting summary table, fitted model, and plot will be re-created. This is so much easier than having a script and needing to change data to new_data for every instance in which it’s referred to.\nYou can also have an overview of your workflow by running tar_visnetwork().\n\n\nFinal thoughts\nUsing a targets workflow requires you to change the way you approach programming. If you’re trained as a statistical programmer, I assume you’re used to writing your code in scripts. A targets workflow requires you to write your code as functions instead (otherwise known as “functional programming”).\nIt is a steep learning curve and it did take me a while to get my head around why and how I should use a targets workflow. It’s a different way of thinking about how to program.\nDespite this, I do highly recommend using a targets workflow instead of having multiple R scripts, for all the reasons I’ve stated above. Utilising this workflow is a step towards reproducible research, which is always great.\n\n\nResources for learning targets\nI think the best way to understand why a targets workflow is useful is to actually do a project within a targets workflow. So here are some resources I found helpful:\n\nThe targets R package user manual with a quick walkthrough to get you started. I highly recommend this one if you’re trying to set up a targets workflow by yourself.\nFor a more hands-on tutorial, I recommend this Carpentries workshop by Joel Nitta. I really liked that this gave you a bare-bones overview of what a targets workflow looks like. I used this the first time I tried to set up a targets workflow, but I also had the benefit of having someone walk me through using targets.\n\nMore readings on targets:\n\nThe official targets website\nWithin the official website: a list of examples for targets workflows"

    "text": "I was recommended Hadley Wickham’s talk The Joy of Functional Programming (for Data Science) when I was struggling to code some iterative processes (you can find his talk on YouTube). The issue I ran into was trying to run row-wise and column-wise functions using for loops in R (a kerfuffle I’ll document in another blog post), which can get quite nasty with nested for loops.\nThe main lesson I learnt from the talk is: some clever programmers have wrapped up for loops in a function, map, that makes writing and reading code so much easier. It takes a while to get used to implementing these functions, but I can already say (in my very short two weeks of using it) that it’s a game-changer for my workflow. I think the main advantage of using map (and its cousins, which you can explore from the purrr package) is that it allow us to focus on both the action and the object whilst programming. In comparison, whilst using for loops I find myself focusing more on the object and the action can get lost. Here’s an example to show you what I mean:\n# For loop approach:\nout1 &lt;- vector(\"double\", ncol(mtcars))\nfor (i in seq_along(mtcars)) {\n  out1[[i]] &lt;- mean(mtcars[[i]], na.rm = TRUE)\n}\n\nout2 &lt;- vector(\"double\", ncol(mtcars))\nfor (i in seq_along(mtcars)) {\n  out2[[i]] &lt;- median(mtcars[[i]], na.rm = TRUE)\n}\n\n# Functional programming approach:\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nout1 &lt;- map_dbl(mtcars, mean, na.rm = TRUE)\nout2 &lt;- mtcars %&gt;% map_dbl(median, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Where map_dbl is an extension of map, returning\n# a vector in double ('dbl') type.\nYou only figure out which actions we’re taking (calculating the mean and median) a few lines down the for loop, after the object has been defined. There is also more room for error as we have to define the object before we run the action every time (i.e. creating the vector and sequencing along each column before calculating the mean and median). The functional programming approach is more concise. You can also see that map plays well with the pipe.\nSomething to note: in the example above, we use map_dbl instead of just map. This is one of the many extensions to the map function; there is also map_chr to return character-type lists.\nI also find the following figure handy to understand how the map functions work:\n\n\n\nThe map function in R. Figure from Hadley Wickham’s Advanced R.\n\n\nAnother thing to note is there are several ways of writing out the same thing using map. In the following bit of code you’ll find four different ways of writing out the same function: finding the number of unique values in each column of the mtcars dataset.\nmap_dbl(mtcars, function(x) length(unique(x)))\n\nmap_dbl(mtcars, ~ length(unique(.x)))\n\nmap_dbl(\n  .x = mtcars,\n  .f = length(unique(.x))\n)\n\nmap_dbl(\n  .x = mtcars,\n  .f = \\(x) length(unique(x))\n)\n\n# All three above returns:\n#&gt; mpg  cyl disp   hp drat   wt qsec   vs   am gear carb \n#&gt;  25    3   27   22   22   29   30    2    2    3    6\nIt took me a while to figure out when I needed to add a dot to the variable (.x)–and to be honest, I still haven’t gotten to the bottom of why we sometimes need to prefix x with a dot (and sometimes not).\nHere’s another simple example, with an equivalent in lapply:\nmap(paths, ~ read.csv(.x))\n\n# Equivalent to the following:\nlapply(paths, function(x) read.csv(x))\nConcise and easy to read.\nThe main issue I had with learning this concept was the steep learning curve. You have to put quite a bit of time into learning which functions are available in the purrr package. I still struggle with figuring out which function I should use and how I should write out the program. But as with most R packages, there are good resources out there that explains these functions really well. So despite the difficulties, I’ll be replacing most of my for loops with map.\n\nUseful links for further reading:\n\nYou can find the purrr website here.\npurrr has a cheat sheet (released by RStudio) here.\nHadley Wickham gives a good explanation of this in Section 9.2 of his Advanced R textbook."

    "text": "A big part of what I do day-to-day is to provide a report of summary statistics. The researchers I work with would usually want this report in the format of a Word document (.docx) as it is (unfortunately) still the most widely used word processing software.\nI much prefer markdown and TeX files for reports, but you have to work to your audience. This is how I went down the rabbit hole of trying to find an R package that outputs summary tables into Word documents. So far I’ve found that gtsummary and table1 combined with the flextable package does the job best.\nAnother package that’s been brought to my attention is stargazer, but alas it only outputs to html. So I’ll walk you through a reproducible example of how to use the gtsummary and table1 packages to create aesthetically pleasing summary tables in Word, supported by the flextable package.\n\nUsing gtsummary\nLet’s create a table for the mtcars data, grouping by engine type (V-shaped vs straight). Here’s how we’d do it using the gtsummary package:\n\nlibrary(gtsummary)\n\nmtcars %&gt;%\n  select(mpg, cyl, disp, am, vs) %&gt;% \n  tbl_summary(by = vs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\n0, N = 181\n1, N = 141\n\n\n\n\nmpg\n15.7 (14.8, 19.1)\n22.8 (21.4, 29.6)\n\n\ncyl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    4\n1 (5.6%)\n10 (71%)\n\n\n    6\n3 (17%)\n4 (29%)\n\n\n    8\n14 (78%)\n0 (0%)\n\n\ndisp\n311 (276, 360)\n121 (83, 162)\n\n\nam\n6 (33%)\n7 (50%)\n\n\n\n1 Median (IQR); n (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot bad–and it plays well with the tidyverse. I also like that gtsummary tends to be smart about how the results should be displayed. For example, the cyl and am variables were automatically treated as discrete instead of continuous variables (thus giving us counts and percentages instead of median and IQR). You’ll notice that if you have the levels of a categorical variable as 0 and 1 (as in am), gtsummary provides only the count and percentage for the values coded as 1, which I’d argue eliminates redundancy.\n\n\nUsing table1\nNow, let’s use the table1 package:\n\nlibrary(table1)\n\ntable1(~ mpg + factor(cyl) + disp + factor(am) | factor(vs),\n       data = mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n(N=18)\n1\n(N=14)\nOverall\n(N=32)\n\n\n\n\nmpg\n\n\n\n\n\nMean (SD)\n16.6 (3.86)\n24.6 (5.38)\n20.1 (6.03)\n\n\nMedian [Min, Max]\n15.7 [10.4, 26.0]\n22.8 [17.8, 33.9]\n19.2 [10.4, 33.9]\n\n\nfactor(cyl)\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n1 (5.6%)\n10 (71.4%)\n11 (34.4%)\n\n\n6\n3 (16.7%)\n4 (28.6%)\n7 (21.9%)\n\n\n8\n14 (77.8%)\n0 (0%)\n14 (43.8%)\n\n\ndisp\n\n\n\n\n\nMean (SD)\n307 (107)\n132 (56.9)\n231 (124)\n\n\nMedian [Min, Max]\n311 [120, 472]\n121 [71.1, 258]\n196 [71.1, 472]\n\n\nfactor(am)\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n12 (66.7%)\n7 (50.0%)\n19 (59.4%)\n\n\n1\n6 (33.3%)\n7 (50.0%)\n13 (40.6%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne could argue that the formula format is a bit tedious as you can’t select the variables (for example, from a list or vector), but I find that you usually need to be cognisant of which variables you want included in a summary table anyways so this isn’t much of a problem for me. I also prefer how it looks as it fits more into the format of a ‘Table 1’ for scientific publishing (hence the package name).\nI did however have to wrap the cyl and am with factor() as table1 does not automatically treat these numeric variables as categorical variables.\n\n\nExporting using flextable\nNow let’s export these tables into Word. First you have to save your table as a flextable object. You do this by either using the as_flex_table() function for a gtsummary object, or the t1flex() function for a table1 object. Once you’ve done that, save_as_docx() saves the table into a Word document which you can copy and paste. Here’s how it would look:\n\n# For gtsummary\ntable &lt;- mtcars %&gt;%\n  select(mpg, cyl, disp, am, vs) %&gt;% \n  tbl_summary(by = vs)\n\nas_flex_table(table) %&gt;% \n  save_as_docx(path = \"./gtsummary.docx\")\n\n# For table1\ntable &lt;- table1(~ mpg + factor(cyl) + disp + factor(am) | factor(vs),\n       data = mtcars)\n\nt1flex(table) %&gt;% \n  save_as_docx(path = \"./table1.docx\")\n\nflextable also supports exporting to HTML, PDF, and PowerPoint documents; it also supports rendering tables as graphic files (such as png and jpeg).\n\n\nAdditional notes\nYou can add content to Word and PowerPoint documents using the officer package, but I haven’t used it before–my end users usually just copy-and-paste the tables. This is a package I’d like to look into."

    "text": "Adapted from Vegan Cookies Invade Your Cookie Jar (goodreads) by Isa Chandra Moskowitz and Terry Hope Romero. Makes about a dozen larger cookies, or 20 smaller cookies.\nIngredients\n\n1-2 very ripe medium banana\n70g canola oil\n100g sugar\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n115g all purpose flour\n0.5 teaspoon baking soda\n0.25 teaspoon salt\n0.25 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n160g rolled oats\n65g toasted chopped walnuts or pecans\n85g chocolate cut up into chunks, or chocolate chips (ideally these would be vegan)\n\nMethod\n\nPreheat oven to 180C. Lightly spray two baking sheets with oil, or line with parchment paper.\nIn a mixing bowl, mash banana(s) well.\nAdd oil, sugar, and vanilla, and mix.\nAdd flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Mix until just moistened.\nAdd oatmeal, walnuts, and chocolate chips. Using your hands or a spoon, mix well, ensuring oats are well-moistened. If dough is very slippery, add a little bit more flour.\nUsing clean, wet hands, roll dough into balls slightly smaller than a golf ball (about 3cm in diameter). Flatten slightly and place 5 cm apart on baking sheet.\nBake until lightly browned, 10-12 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool for two minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container.\n\n\nNotes\nAs I’m not vegan, I prefer recipes that don’t rely on egg replacement products such as flaxseed.\nOther books I’d like to read about vegan baking:\n\nVegan cupcakes take over the world (goodreads)\nThe joy of vegan baking (goodreads)"
