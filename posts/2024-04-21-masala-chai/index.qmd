Adapted from [Dishoom: From Bombay with love](https://www.dishoom.com/cookery-book/) ([goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/44569827)). Serves 4.

Ingredients

-   Approximately 12cm by 2cm piece of ginger, sliced thinly into rounds
-   2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns
-   18 cardamom pods
-   3 cinnamon sticks
-   8 cloves
-   1L water
-   4 teabags: Assam or Ceylon[^1]
-   50g granulated sugar
-   500ml whole milk

[^1]: I find Assam to be the best kind of tea. In a pinch, the usual Lipton black teabags would also do.

Tools

-   1.75L capacity saucepan
-   Strainer

Method

1.  Pour the ginger and spices into a saucepan. Pour 1 litre of boiling water over the ginger and spices. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, until fragrant.
2.  Place tea in saucepan. Turn up the heat to bring to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes.
3.  Add 8 teaspoons (about 32g) of sugar and all 500ml of milk. Turn up the heat and bring to a boil. Lower heat to a simmer, and allow to simmer for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste to see if it's to your liking; adjust sugar if needed. If you want the chai to taste stronger, leave to boil for longer.
4.  Strain and discard the solids. Serve immediately.
