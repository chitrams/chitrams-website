*3 November update: This list will be updated as I find more resources.*

As I do more and more programming, I'm finding computer science unavoidable. Specifically, the hardware side of things. I think it's important to understand the basics of how computers workâ€“in other words, "computer architecture"-if you want to write better code.

I never received a formal education in computer science, so it was important to find resources that were accessible. Here's my round-up of the best resources I found.

## Dipping your toes

-   The **Computer Science Crash Course** playlist on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo) is fantastic. It's what it says it is (a crash course), so you'll learn just enough to prepare you for diving deeper.
-   **Code: The hidden language of computer hardware and software** by Charles Petzold ([Google Books](https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Code/iNfPEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)) is an excellent book that starts you from the very beginning (0's and 1's) and conceptually builds towards how computers work. I highly recommend this if you'd like an intuitive understanding of hardware and software. I also think he's a great writer.

## More advanced topics

-   The course **Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris** on [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer). You can also find the Nand2Tetris homepage [here](https://www.nand2tetris.org/). I thought this was a really good course. It is quite detailed; I only skimmed through I'm not (yet) interested in building my own computer.
