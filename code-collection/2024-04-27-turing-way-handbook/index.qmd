I first came across this project when trying to figure out what version control was and how to use Git. I got what I wanted: the handbook includes chapters on [version control](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/vcs.html), [code testing](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/testing), and [continuous integration](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/ci.html) (including how to set up [continuous integration with GitHub Actions](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/ci/ci-github-actions)). What I loved about this project is they went the extra mile and also explained concepts in research and software reproducibility such as [reusable code](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/code-reuse), and included a chapter on [how to communicate](https://book.the-turing-way.org/communication/communication) your research.

It's an excellent resource for learning about how to set up your projects for reproducibility.
