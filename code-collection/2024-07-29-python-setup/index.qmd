- To go into the Python interpreter in VS Code > Command Prompt, type `python`
- TO exit, type `exit()` or `quit()` or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Z followed by Enter on Windows

How I installed it without admin rights:
- Download anaconda
- Add the three lines to PATH: Edit Environment Variables to your account
	- anaconda3
	- anaconda3/Scripts
	- anaconda3/Library/bin
- Then in VS code change the default terminal to command prompt instead of PwerShell (still not sure hwy this helps)
