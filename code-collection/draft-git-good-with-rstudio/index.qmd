Git is one of those things that I've always known I *should* learn how to use, but never got around to actually learning because my workflow wasn't crap enough to justify putting the effort into learning it. I think it also has a steep learning curve (you need to learn a different way of thinking about managing your digital workflow), and the official documentation isn't the most accessible. So I completely understand why a lot of statisticians and researchers I know aren't convinced about using Git.

Recently though my work has required using version control so other people can see what I've been up to. From that, I've been pleasantly surprised to find that using Git is also useful for my own personal projects, even if I'm the only person working on it. I did struggle to set Git up in RStudio, though, as I don't have access to admin rights on my work PC which runs Windows.
